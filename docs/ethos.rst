Ethos 
=============

In phylogenetics, standard practice is to simulate independent gene trees and force mutations onto them. In `ipcoal`, we instead simulate the spatial arrangement gene trees along chromosomes.

As a tool for research and teaching, it was important to us that `ipcoal` is person-friendly. To that aim, we made our tool accessible, reproducible, and transparent. Explore the documentation below and give it a try.

Our goals:
-------------

- Accessible: Easy to install and easy to use, with documentation and cookbooks.
- Reproducible: Designed for interactive use in Jupyter notebooks for easy sharing.
- Transparent: Read our code and make it your own.
