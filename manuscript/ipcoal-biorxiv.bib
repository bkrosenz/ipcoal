	abstract = {A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples. Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more quickly than with existing methods.},

The method uses the same statistic, χ2 LF, used by Langley and Fitch (1973, 1974) and Fitch and Langley (1976). The distribution of χ2 LF, characterized in this study with Monte Carlo simulations, depends on the parameter θ (=4Nu). The values of θ required to explain the observed value of χ2 LF are determined and found to be incompatible with the low levels of heterozygosity observed at the hemoglobin loci in humans. It is concluded that the constant-rate neutral model is highly improbable. Other neutral models and models involving natural selection need to be considered.},

In Who We Are and How We Got Here, Reich allows listeners to discover how the human genome provides not only all the information a human embryo needs to develop but also the hidden story of our species. Reich delves into how the genomic revolution is transforming our understanding of modern humans and how DNA studies reveal deep inequalities among different populations, between the sexes, and among individuals. Provocatively, Reich's book suggests that there might very well be biological differences among human populations but that these differences are unlikely to conform to common stereotypes.Drawing upon revolutionary findings and unparalleled scientific studies, Who We Are and How We Got Here is a captivating glimpse into humankind--where we came from and what that says about our lives today.},

	abstract = {Toytree is a lightweight Python library for programmatically visualizing and manipulating tree-based data structures. It implements a minimalist design aesthetic and modern plotting architecture suited for interactive coding in IPython/Jupyter. Tree drawings are generated in HTML using the toyplot library backend, and display natively in Jupyter notebooks with interactivity features. Tree drawings can be combined with other plotting functions from the toyplot library (e.g. scatterplots, histograms) to create composite figures on a shared coordinate grid, and can be exported to additional formats including PNG, PDF and SVG. To parse and store tree data, toytree uses a modified fork of the ete3 TreeNode object, which includes functions for manipulating, annotating and comparing trees. Toytree integrates these functions with a plotting layout to allow node values to be extracted from trees in the correct order to style nodes for plotting. In addition, toytree provides functions for parsing additional tree formats, generating random trees, inferring consensus trees and drawing grids or clouds from multiple trees to visualize discordance. The goal of toytree is to provide a simple Python equivalent to commonly used tree manipulation and plotting libraries in R, and in doing so, to promote further development of phylogenetic and other tree-based methods in Python. Toytree is released under the GPLv3 license. Source code is available on GitHub and documentation is available at https://toytree.readthedocs.io.},

Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to duplication of effort and the possibility for error. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a standard catalog of published simulation models from a wide range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage an even broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent advances in genealogical modeling suggest that resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.
